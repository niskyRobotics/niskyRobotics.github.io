We are a student organization at Niskayuna High School and are committed to 
positively influencing our community through our outreach, as well as competing
in the US FIRST Technology Challenge. The 2015-16 season will be our fourth season so far.

Our research and development activities include 3d-printable designs useful for FIRST robots, shared
on Thingiverse, as well as a software library for intelligent motion planning on the new Java-based
platform FIRST has put into place in the 2015-16 season.

Our mission statement is to "fill in this with an actual mission statement".
